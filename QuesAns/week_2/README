Set-list.c is complete
- except that it does not keep the values in order

Set-flex-array.c is complete
- except that it does not keep the values in order

Set-bits.c is complete
- but I didn't test it

Other Set-*.c are in various stages of incompleteness

Note: if you change Set-*.c, you didn't change Set.c
- so make will think there's nothing to recompile
- to force this, pretend Set.c changed via "touch Set.c"
